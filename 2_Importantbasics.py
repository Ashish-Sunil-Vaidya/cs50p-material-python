# In Python, if you try to emaphasize something in a string by using "" inside the string, your computer will not consider "" inside the string as output and will give syntax error

#if you want to use "" inside the string, you can use alternate '' and "" combination after parenthesis for example: 

# print('Hello "Python" ')

#OR

# Use escape sequence character by using '\' before ""

# print("Hello \"Python\" ")

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER INDENTATION(TAB) IS THE CURLY BRACKETS OF PYTHON.
